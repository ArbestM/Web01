                    <p>The mask in black Africa represents, with the statuary, an important element of plastic creation. Both are at the heart of traditional socio-religious life. It was at the end of the 19th century that African art became widely accessible to European collectors and provided the greatest artists, painters and sculptors with confirmation of the merits of their research and justification for the use of forms of expression. freed from figurative naturalism. R. Fry affirmed as early as 1920: “The main merit of African sculpture is its total plastic freedom ... It seems that the passage from a flat surface to a round does not pose any problem for them. The primary objective of African sculpture is not, in fact, to represent the visible world but to make sensitive realities of a moral or supernatural order, it is an abstract art by definition; he
                      does not seek to arouse the only aesthetic emotion, hence its power of fascination.</p>

                    <p>One of the best definitions of the African mask is undoubtedly that of W. Fagg: “All the objects to which the name of“ mask ”must be attributed can be defined in two words: they mask. This means that they hide or suppress the identity. They literally and figuratively mask the wearer in order to help him personify a wandering force, spirit or god, by charming it with its own image to better capture and maneuver it. The sculpted part, the most worked, which one shows in the museums is only one part of the mask, which consists, in fact, of a complete costume, which has a proper name (there is practically no generic term), and which is exhibited during ceremonies in which music and dance are an integral part. These ceremonies are also shows, staging the great existential problems developed through specific mythologies: struggle between good and evil,
                      mystery of origins, anguish of death. These representations, "masquerades"</p>

                    <h3>Ocean</h3>
                    <p>For Oceanians, the mask or the disguise of the body often makes it possible to make an ancestral spirit (human, animal, plant or personified object) speak and act in an educational concern, vis-à-vis the youngest, in order to evoke the mythical history of the group. The mask is not always a representation of a face placed in front of the real face of the wearer, it can be presented as a set of elements (hairstyle, balaclava, chasuble, etc.) covering all or part of the body. Thus, during the course of a ceremony, the mask allows the wearer to identify with an ancestor or a mythical hero and
                      to thus assert its place in the social organization. Many types of masks are no longer manufactured today, so they will be referred to here in the past.</p>
